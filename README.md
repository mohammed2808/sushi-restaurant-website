This website is designed for a sushi restaurant, offering customers the ability to browse the menu, place orders, and reserve tables online.
Built using React (JSX) for functionality and Tailwind CSS for styling, with some custom CSS for additional customization, the site is fully responsive and optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

The project consists of four main pages:

Home Page: The landing page, which serves as the introduction to the restaurant and provides easy access to the other sections.
Menu Page: Features a comprehensive list of dishes organized into categories, allowing customers to browse and place orders with ease.
Reservation Page: Displays customer reservations and allows users to view and manage their table bookings.
About Us Page: Contains essential information about the restaurant, including its history, mission, and culinary expertise.
Local storage is utilized for managing the shopping cart (panier) and reservation details, ensuring a seamless experience for users.

This project marks my first venture into front-end development, and I hope you find the website intuitive and enjoyable to use.
